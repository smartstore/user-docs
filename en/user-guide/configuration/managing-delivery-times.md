# Managing Delivery Times

When configuring your products, you should inform your customers about the time it will take for the products to be delivered to them. To do so, you can add a delivery time to your products, which you can choose in the [Product Info Tab](https://smartstore.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/resumedraft.action?draftId=1956121112) when configuring your products. To manage delivery times, go to **Configuration > Lists > Delivery Times**. When editing a delivery time, you can specify a default **Display Name** and an alternative Display Name for every language that's configured in your store. You can also specify a color value that indicates the delivery time range. If a product can be shipped immediately after the payment has been received, the color green should be shown. If a product has to be ordered with a manufacturer, hence taking a long time to be delivered, the color red should be displayed.
