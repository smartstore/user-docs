# Catalog Settings

In the section **Catalog Settings**, you can edit global settings relating to the representation of your catalog. There won't be an explanation for every setting, as some of them are self-explanatory. If the setting you are looking for isn't documented, hover over the space between the title and input field of the setting. A question mark will appear, containing a hint about the setting.
