# Setting up Activity Types

In a shop, there are several activities that occur multiple times every day. Smartstore logs them in the **Activity Log**, which you can view by navigating to **Customers > Activity Log**. There are several activity types that are created during the installation of Smartstore. However, you can decide which activities are important to you and hence should be logged. You can turn activities on and off by navigating to **Configuration > Activity Types**. You can enable or disable them by checking or unchecking the value **Is Enabled** in the data grid and clicking **Save** afterwards.
