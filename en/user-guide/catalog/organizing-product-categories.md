# Organizing Product Categories

To manage your product groups, navigate to **Catalog > Product** Groups in the administration area in Smartstore. Using the upper buttons you can activate the list view or the tree view. Here you can add, edit or delete product groups. The list view shows all created product groups in an ordered list and provides you with a search widget so that you can easily find the product group you are looking for. The tree view allows you to rearrange the structure of your merchandise groups and subgroups by dragging and dropping. 

## List View

The list view offers a filter function that allows you to filter by different commodity **group names** or the **alias**. Here you also have the option to export your commodity groups to an XML file.

## Tree View

The order of categories you see in the tree view will be applied to the category structure in the frontend of the shop and will be the main navigation that your shop visitor uses to find products in your store. To rearrange your categories you can simply drag them to the designated place and drop them there.

## Category Details View

When adding or editing a category, you'll be forwarded to the category details view as shown on the screen below. Here, you can enter all the data that's related to this category in six different tabs. With the buttons in the upper right corner, you can preview the work you've done, save it or delete the category. When you select the option to delete a category, a new window appears asking you whether the subcategories should be deleted or placed in the root.
