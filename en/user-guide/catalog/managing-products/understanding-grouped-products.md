# Understanding Grouped Products

With grouped products, you can present multiple products on a single product detail page. Rather than offering a product more or less isolated from the rest of your catalog, you can present associated products together on one page, where each product becomes a separate cart item. Working with grouped products provides the following benefits:

- Better, more practically-oriented structuring of your catalog data.
- Easier detection of similar products when they are grouped, hence more sales.
- More sales when customers see useful, required or desirable products on the same page.

> [!INFO]
> When you associate a simple product to a grouped product, you can specify whether the simple product is **individually visible** (or just visible on the grouped product page). A product that is not **individually** **visible** does not appear in search results or in product lists of categories.

## Usage scenario

Imagine you want to sell a video game console. If someone is interested in buying one, he may also be interested in buying:

- One or multiple games
- A wireless controller
- A wireless headset
- A USB charge cable

Assigning products to a grouped product

1. Switch to the **Associated products**  tab of your grouped product and click **Add new associated product**.
2. Select one or more products by activating the checkbox in the first column. You can use the search form to find the products you want to associate more quickly.
3. Click the **Save** button. The selected products now appear in the grid of associated products.
4. You can remove the assignment again by clicking **Delete** in the grid of associated products.
5. You can change the display order of the associated products on the grouped product page by clicking **Edit** and changing the order value.
