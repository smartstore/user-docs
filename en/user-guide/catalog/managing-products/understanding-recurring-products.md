# Understanding Recurring Products

Recurring products are products that need to be billed and shipped periodically. 

## Usage Scenario

Imagine you run a bookstore that also sells magazine subscriptions. You would need to charge the price of a magazine periodically, and Smartstore is optimally prepared for this scenario. You simply need to select the option **Recurring Product** in the **Product Info** tab in the product detail view of the administration area. Then, you can determine the recurrence period for a product by setting the time unit (**Cycle Period**) and the duration (**Cycle Length**). Finally, you can set the number of **Total Cycles**. Let's say you want to sell a six-month subscription for a magazine published monthly. In this case, you would set the **Cycle Length** to 1, the **Cycle Period** to *Month* and the number of **Total Cycles** to 6.
