# Bulk Edit Products

You can perform **product mass processing** directly in the **Product Management list**. 

## Usage Scenario

Imagine you've got new prices from your wholesaler and need to update the prices of your products. You don't need to go to every detail view of your products. The bulk edit feature of Smartstore was specifically created for this purpose. Just filter for the products which need to be updated, doubleclick in the price field and edit it.
