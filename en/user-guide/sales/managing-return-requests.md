# Managing Return Requests

If you're selling products online, you need to consider that some products will be returned for a variety of reasons. Customers could return a product because it isn't the way they imagined it to be, it has a defect, or they chose an incorrect attribute when placing the order. To do so,  they would log into the customer area, submit a return request and send the product back to you. In Smartstore, return requests can be enabled or disabled in **Order Settings > Return Request Settings**. You can manage all return requests received by navigating to **Sales > Return Requests**.

## The Customers Details View 

Before your customers can return products, the corresponding order has to be marked as **Complete**. If the order is completed, your customers can return products in their login area by navigating to **Orders** and clicking on **Return Item(s)**. They will be forwarded to a form where they can choose the items they want to return and specify the reasons for returning the product. They will also be able to choose how the return will be handled (**Return Action: Repair, Replacement, Store Credit**).

## The Administrator Details View

In the details view of a return request, you can **Accept** the return request, edit the details and notify the customer about the status of his/her request.
