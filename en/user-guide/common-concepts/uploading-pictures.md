# Uploading Pictures

Pictures can be added to all kinds of objects you create in your store (e.g. products, product groups or the content slider). To upload these images, you always use the same tool: the **Picture Uploader**. With the Picture Uploader you can add pictures via the file manager of your operating system or add them directly via drag and drop with the mouse. To use your operating system's file manager, click **Drop files here to upload or click.** Alternatively, you can drag and drop an image onto this space using your mouse. If you have multiple images, you can drag and drop to change the order. You can mark an image as the main image and, if desired, exclude it from being displayed in the product detail gallery. To delete an image, move the mouse over the image and click the **Remove** button there.     
Pictures that have been uploaded will be stored in the file system or database according to the setting you've chosen in the [Media Settings](../../user-guide/configuration/general-settings-preferences/media-settings.md).
