# Analyzing Customer Activity

When running an online shop you can optimize your shop by analyzing customer activity. 

## Activity Log

You can analyze the activity log by going to **Customers > Activity Log**, where you can see all the activities that have occurred in your store. You can filter the activities for a certain date range, by customer e-mail or by **Activity Log Type**. The **Activity Log Types** contain activities that happened in the backend (e.g. edit product or category) as well as in the frontend (e.g. customer has added a product to the shopping cart or customer has placed an order). By clicking on the e-mail address in the grid, you'll be directed to the customer details views of the customer for which the activity has been logged.

## Customer Reports

By going to **Customers > Customers Reports** you can analyze the orders that were placed in your shop. You can filter the list for a certain date range, the order status, the payment status or the shipping status by setting the corresponding filter criteria and clicking the button **Run Report**. The tab **Top 20 Customers By Order Total** will display the filter results ordered by order total and the tab **Top 20 Customers By Number Of Orders** by the number of orders. The tab **Registered Customers** will show you how many customers have registered at your store in certain periods.
