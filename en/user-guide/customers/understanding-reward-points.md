# Understanding Reward Points

The **Reward Points Program** allows customers to earn points for certain actions they take on the site. Points are awarded based on making purchases and customer actions such as registering or writing product reviews.  For more information about the different settings that can be applied to reward points, read the topic  [Reward Point Settings](../../user-guide/configuration/general-settings-preferences/reward-point-settings.md) .

Your customers can use their reward points in the checkout process by checking a box on the payment selection page. When they have opted to use their reward points, the monetary value of the gathered reward points will be subtracted from the order total on the order confirmation page.

## Usage Scenario

Imagine you've just turned on the product review feature in Smartstore and you want to gather as many product reviews as possible in a short period of time. In that case, you should give your customers incentives to write reviews in your shop by offering them reward points.
