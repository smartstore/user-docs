# Block specific settings

### Text

The Text block provides comprehensive options for formatting text. The Title field allows you to assign a formatted title to the block. The title is displayed above the intro and text element. In addition, the block is given the title as a name in the Block Manager. Alternatively, you can hide the title, which will cause it not to be displayed as text within the block. The tagline is displayed above and the intro below the title. The text field, which is intended for continuous text, has an extensive text editor that you can use to format your continuous text. Furthermore, the individual text elements offer options to configure font size, font type, font color, HTML tags and spacing.
