1. **Text**: Displays text in a formatted way. Furthermore, the text block can display buttons, icons, backgrounds, effects, and more.
2. **Image**: Displays a single image. The image block is best suited for displaying an image without text.

4. **Categories**: Similar to the product list, this block lists merchandise groups.
5. **Brands**: Similar to the product list, this block lists manufacturers.
6. **IFrame**: Displays external pages within an IFrame.
7. **Gallery**: Presents images in a list, grid, or as a slider.

19. **ViewComponent**: This block is intended for developers. Using the ViewComponent block, you can include your own modules.
20. **Story**: Inserts already existing stories as an atomic block. In this way, you can easily and quickly create very extensive and large stories, which are composed of several smaller stories.

All these blocks have the same basic settings, such as background and effects. You can learn more about the basic settings under Block basic settings. You can also learn more about the individual blocks under Block-specific settings.
