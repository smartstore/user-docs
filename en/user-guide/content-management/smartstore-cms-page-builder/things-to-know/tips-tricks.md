# Tips & Tricks

## Best practices

### Mobile First

Keep the mobile-first concept in mind. Design and create your story from small to big - from mobile to desktop.

### Make changes

If you make changes to your story later, make sure it has the desired effect at higher resolution levels. If different settings are already entered there, they will not be overwritten.

### Testing

Test your finished story extensively for all different resolutions and devices.

### Preview mode

Use the preview mode regularly to get a better impression of your story in the final display. In addition, many effects and story backgrounds are only displayed in preview mode.

### Header tags

Due to SEO technical reasons, you should be very sparing with the use of h1 and h2 tags. You can set the font size of a text block separately regardless of the h\* tag.

### Placing text on an image

If you want to display text on an image, it is best to use only the text block and insert the image as a background.
