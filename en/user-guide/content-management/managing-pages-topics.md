# Managing Pages & Topics

You can manage pages and topics by navigating to **CMS > Topic**. In this section, you can edit and add pages for which you need to define your own content (e.g. Legal Notice or About Us). For this purpose, you need to use the HTML Editor. For more information about editing HTML content, read the topic [Editing HTML Content](../../user-guide/common-concepts/editing-html-content.md). If you want to add links to the menus of your shop for the topics you have created, read the topic [How to add my own Links to the Shop Menus](https://smartstore.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=SD&title=How%20to%20add%20my%20own%20Links%20to%20the%20Shop%20Menus).

## Render HTML Widgets

Widget zones are placeholders that allow you to insert widgets and HTML blocks anywhere in your shop. Every single building block in Smartstore is richly populated with widget zones, giving you maximum freedom to place the content you like anywhere you like. To place your own content anywhere in the shop, select the option **Render As Html Widget** for the topic in question. Then, just enter the HTML you want to display and choose the corresponding widget zone. For more information about widget zones and a complete list of all widget zones, read the topic [Widget Zones](https://smartstore.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SMNET50/pages/1956122279/Widget+Zones) .
