# Managing Blogs

*Content is King* is a commonly used phrase relating to search engine optimization, and it exists for a good reason. Google likes fresh content and gives a higher ranking to sites that are always creating new textual content. Smartstore contains a system to manage your own blog, enabling you to create new content on a regular basis.

In this tab, you can manage which store(s) the blog post should be published in. For more information about multiple stores, read the topic [Working with Multiple Stores](https://smartstore.atlassian.net/wiki/display/SMNET/Working+with+multiple+Stores).

## Managing New Comments

If you have allowed customers to leave comments on your blog posts, you need to review the comments and perhaps delete them. You can manage the comments to your blog posts by navigating to **CMS > Blog > Blog Comments**. In this section, you can see an overview of all the comments along with additional information such as the customer who created the comment, his IP address or the date the comment was created. You can also delete comments here.
