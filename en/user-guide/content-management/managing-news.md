# Managing News

*Content is King* is a commonly used phrase relating to search engine optimization, and it exists for a good reason. Google likes fresh content and gives a higher ranking to sites that are frequently creating new textual content. Smartstore contains a system to manage news entries, enabling shop administrators to create new content on a regular basis. The news you create can be displayed on the home page of your shop, and are made available through an RSS feed based on the settings you've configured in [News Settings](../../user-guide/configuration/general-settings-preferences/news-settings.md).

### Search Engines (SEO)

In this tab, you can enter specific SEO values for the news item, e.g. **Meta title**, **Meta keywords** or a SEO-friendly **URL alias**. For more information about the fields in the **Seach Engines** tab, read the topic [SEO](https://smartstore.atlassian.net/wiki/display/SMNET/SEO).

### Stores

In this tab, you can manage which store(s) the news item should be published in. For more information about multiple stores, read the topic [Working with Multiple Stores](https://smartstore.atlassian.net/wiki/display/SMNET/Working+with+multiple+Stores).

## Managing New Comments

If you have allowed customers to leave comments on your news items, you need to review the comments and perhaps delete them. You can manage the comments to your news items by navigating to **CMS > News > News Comments**. In this section, you can see an overview of all comments, along with additional information such as the customer who created the comment, his IP address or the date the comment was created. You can also delete comments here.
