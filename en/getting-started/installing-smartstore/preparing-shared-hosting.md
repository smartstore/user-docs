# Preparing Shared Hosting

## Windows Shared Hosting

Smartstore will run on any Windows Shared Hosting that supports [**ASP.NET**](http://ASP.NET) **Core Runtime 9**. Please check with your hoster if this is the case.

Simply copy the installation files to the web folder specified by the hoster. In most cases you will need an FTP program to do this. If the installation files are in a ZIP archive, the contents must be unpacked and then transferred. When the files have been transferred completely, you can proceed with the [**installation**](../installing-smartstore/starting-smartstore-installation.md).

## Linux Shared Hosting

To run .NET applications like Smartstore on a shared Linux hosting, "**root**" (or sudo) rights for the shared hosting are required. Since the offer is very limited and the additional costs for a Linux server are kept within limits, we recommend using a **Linux server**.
